# Masyde Cyber Research
🛡️ **Mission: Advanced Threat Emulation and Defensive Research**

Masyde is an open-source collective focused on reverse-engineering advanced cyber threats, building detections, and releasing defensive tools. We emulate adversary TTPs in safe environments to strengthen security controls — strictly non-offensive, for global resilience.

🔎 **Focus Areas**

| Area                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Reverse Engineering** | Deconstruct binaries and scripts to extract IOCs and map execution flows. |
| **Threat Emulation**    | Build controlled, non-malicious APT simulations to validate defenses. |
| **Detection Engineering** | Craft high-fidelity rules (YARA, Sigma) for emerging attack patterns. |
| **Vulnerability Research** | Identify, document, and responsibly disclose flaws in software for patching. |
| **Open Source Tooling**   | Release analysis scripts, utilities, and reports under OSS licenses. |

📝 **Core Workflow**
1. **Analyze & Reverse**: Deep-dive into novel malware or techniques.
2. **Emulate & Test**: Simulate threats in isolated environments.
3. **Develop Defenses**: Engineer and validate detection/mitigation logic.
4. **Publish**: Share IOCs, rules, and code in this repo.
